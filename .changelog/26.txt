```release-note:breaking-change
module/encryption: Expose `enabled_for_search_nodes` with secure default (`true`) to control BYOK encryption for dedicated search nodes. Existing deployments with `encryption.enabled = true` and dedicated search nodes will see `enabled_for_search_nodes` flip from `false` to `true` on upgrade. This triggers search node reprovisioning and index rebuild. Set `enabled_for_search_nodes = false` explicitly to preserve current behavior.
